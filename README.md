afpmount-workflow
=================

An Alfred workflow that mounts AFP shares in the network using SMB host names.
Since I'm having trouble with mDNS / Bonjour, but nevertheless want to mount
network shares via AFP, I decided to write this Alfred Workflow that can lookup
IPs of an SMB share in the network and mounts an AFP share on the same
host / IP address.

(Obviously) only running on Macs (tested in OSX 10.9 Mavericks).
